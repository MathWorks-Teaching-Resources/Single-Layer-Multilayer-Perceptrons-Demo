# Single-Layer and Multilayer Perceptrons Demo
This MATLABÂ® demo introduces fundamental concepts of neural networks in an intuitive and hands-on manner, from single-layer neural networks and corresponding learning algorithms, to multilayer perceptrons. It is meant to be used in class or by those interested in an intuitive understanding of these theoretical concepts.

The demo consists of two files:
- Perceptron.mlapp: an interactive MATLAB app illustrating the perceptron architecture, geometric interpretation, and learned algorithm for provided input parameters.
- DeepLearningFundamentals.mlx: a MATLAB live script demoing the app in an intuitive, incremental manner.

### MathWorks Products (https://www.mathworks.com)
Developed in MATLAB release R2020a, tested in release R2020a and newer.

## Getting Started 
Follow the workflow described in the live script for examples on using the Perceptron app to introduce fundamental concepts of neural networks.
